  Upgrade of gets stuck with one or more nodes in an old Kubernetes version.
"Description" : |
  A sample output as a result of this issue:
  ```bash
  2022-03-31T14:00:46.3605901Z VERBOSE: [03/31/2022 07:00:46] [Kva]   Current status of cluster nodes:

  ```

  To see the machine which is stuck in a deleting state, run the following command:

  ```bash  
  kubectl get machines -o wide --kubeconfig (Get-KvaConfig).kubeconfig
  ```

  Note the machine with `PHASE` Deleting and `VERSION` matching the previous Kubernetes version.

"Fix" : |
  To address this problem, you will need the following pieces of information:
  1. Kubernetes version to which your are upgrading your target cluster.
  2. IP address of the node which is stuck.

  To find this information, run the following cmdlet and command:

  ```powershell
  Get-AksHciCredential -name <target cluster name>
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

  You can identify the node which needs to be fixed because it will have status such as `Ready,SchedulingDisabled`. Use the `INTERNAL-IP` of this node as the IP address value in the following command below. Use the `VERSION` value from the node with roles `control-plane,master` as the Kubernetes version value.

  ``ssh -i (Get-MocConfig).sshPrivateKey -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no  clouduser@<IP address> sudo crictl pull --creds <your-credential> ecpacr.azurecr.io/kube-proxy:<Kubernetes version>``

  After running this ssh command, the remaining nodes with the old Kubernetes version should be deleted and the upgrade will proceed.
