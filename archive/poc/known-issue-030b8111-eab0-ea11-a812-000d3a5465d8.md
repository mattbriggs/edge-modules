### Cannot delete an NSG if NICs not attached to running VM

- Applicable to: all
- Description: When disassociating an NSG and a NIC that is not attached to a running VM, the update (PUT) operation for that object fails at the network controller layer. The NSG will be updated at the network resource provider layer, but not on the network controller, so the NSG moves to a failed state. Remdiation: Attach the NICs associated to the NSG that needs to be removed with running VMs, and disassociate the NSG or remove all the NICs that were associated with the NSG. 
- Remediation: NA
- Occurrence: Common
